    <h1>Integrating Dear ImGui with MonoGame</h1>
<p>I've been messing around with gamedev on my M2 Mac and because I enjoy making things harder on myself apparently, I'm trying not to use Unity.</p>
<p>One of the goals for my fiddling was to be able to learn more about <a href="https://github.com/ocornut/imgui" target="_blank">Dear ImGui</a>, an immediate-mode GUI library that's widely used across the industry for custom debug views and tooling. Getting ImGui working with Monogame on my mac has been a fun adventure in building and maintaining native dependencies so I figured I'd write a bit about how I got it working.</p>
<h2>ImGui Native Dependencies</h2>
<p>I made the decision to separate all of the native code work out from my game code and just copy over the built binaries to a <code>lib</code> folder in that project.</p>
<p>In the native project, I made a fork of this supremely useful OSS project:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://github.com/AesteroidBlues/cimgui/" target="_blank">cimgui</a>: A generator to create a C wrapper around ImGui</li>
</ul>
<p>cimgui takes a dependency on Dear ImGui through a Git submodule - the workflow is to update that submodule to the version of ImGui you want to use and then re-run the cimgui generator. Doing that requires LuaJIT which is trivially installed on OSX with <code>brew install luajit</code> and non-trivially installed on Windows with downloading things and setting path variables ðŸ˜Š</p>
<p>Once you've got the C bindings generated you can use CMake to generate a Makefile or Visual Studio solution and compile the binaries for your platform. Done!</p>
<h2>ImGui.NET Wrapper</h2>
<p>Once you've got some binaries, the next step is to allow for interop with C#. Thankfully, this project exists:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://github.com/AesteroidBlues/ImGui.NET/" target="_blank">ImGui.NET</a>: A generator that creates C# bindings and interop automatically from cimgui</li>
</ul>
<p>cimgui creates several artifacts as part of its generation process which ImGui.NET uses to intelligently generate C# methods and an interop layer so you don't have to do annoying pointer pinning every time you want to call an ImGui function. The two files you need from cimgui/generator are: <code>definitions.json</code> and <code>structs_and_enums.json</code></p>
<p>Place those files in <code>src/CodeGenerator/definitions/cimgui</code> and run the CodeGenerator project from Visual Studio. That will output all your generated .cs files to the project's bin folder which you can then copy over to <code>/src/ImGui.NET/Generated</code>. Finally, compiling ImGui.NET from Visual Studio will give you an ImGui.NET.dll you can reference from your MonoGame project.</p>
<p>You'll also need to put your native binaries you built earlier in a place your MonoGame executable can see them. I have a python script that copies the appropriate binaries from my <code>lib</code> folder to my game's output directory to make sure they're always up to date and in the right spot.</p>

<h2>Extending ImGui - ImNodes, ImPlot and ImGuizmo</h2>
<p>If you want even more UI tools to play with, ImGui.NET also supports three additional ImGui-based libraries:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://github.com/AesteroidBlues/cimnodes" target="_blank">cimnodes</a>: A tool set for creating node-based visual scripts, similar to Unreal Blueprints</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/AesteroidBlues/cimplot" target="_blank">cimplot</a>: A set of graphing and plotting tools for ImGui</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/AesteroidBlues/cimguizmo" target="_blank">cimguizmo</a>: A library of 3d gizmos, also contains a sequencer and graph editor that are not parsed by the C generator.</li>
</ul>
<p>The process for including these libraries is almost exactly the same as for ImGui - simply check out the version you want in the appropriate native library and run the LuaJIT generator - it's required that these dependencies all live next to the cimgui dependency in your folder structure, e.g.</p>
<pre><code>    - deps
        - cimgui
        - cimplot
        - cimnodes
        - cimguizmo
</code></pre>
<p>Once those are generated, copy over the above JSON files to the appropriate subfolder in <code>ImGui.NET/src/CodeGenerator/definitions</code> and run the code generator with the command line flag for the library you want to build (the options are in <code>CodeGenerator/Program.cs</code>). Finally copy those generated files back over to the appropriate <code>ImGui.NET/&lt;project&gt;/Generated</code> folder and build the library.</p>
<p>Note: as of this writing the upstream ImGui.NET does not correctly generate ImNodes which is why I'm linking to all my forks of these projects - they all are set to versions of each library that play nicely with each other and contain fixes to allow everything to work.</p>

<h2>Extending ImGui Even Further - Custom Widgets</h2>
<p>The final hurdle came when I needed a bezier curve editor for my game's tooling. I found a great looking tool on <a href="https://github.com/ocornut/imgui/issues/786#issue-172274967" target="_blank">the ImGui discussion page</a> but it requires ImGui calls that are only available in <code>imgui_internal.h</code> which is not exposed via ImGui.NET. Instead of trying to expose these calls to C# I decided it would be easier and more extensible to just build the widgets in C++ and invoke them from C#.</p>
<p><a href="https://github.com/AesteroidBlues/startup-hell-native-dependencies/blob/master/src/ImGuiCurveWidget.h" target="_blank">Here</a> I define a C-style header with the appropriate API flags to tell the compiler not to mangle the function names and include this header from a .cpp file that implements the widget. Then, using CMake, I can create a native binary that gets built in a manner similar to cimgui.</p>
<p>Finally, I needed my own translation layer between the new native code and my C# project as I didn't want to modify ImGui.NET to be aware of my new classes. I created my own C# project with two files: <code>Wrapper.cs</code> and <code>Interface.cs</code>. Wrapper simply declares the native functions and the appropriate <code>DllImport</code> attributes, while Interface defines the C# API my library will expose and handles the native calling messiness in a similar way to ImGui.NET.</p>

<h2>Final thoughts</h2>
<p>If you made it this far you're probably trying to integrate ImGui into your own C# project, hopefully this guide has been helpful. I've open sourced my native dependencies library here, I hope it helps!</p>
